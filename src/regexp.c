 *** THIS IS AN ALTERED VERSION.  It was altered by John Gilmore,
 *** hoptoad!gnu, on 27 Dec 1986, to add \n as an alternative to |
 *** to assist in implementing egrep.
 *** THIS IS AN ALTERED VERSION.  It was altered by John Gilmore,
 *** hoptoad!gnu, on 28 Dec 1986, to add \< and \> for word-matching
 *** as in BSD grep and ex.
 *** THIS IS AN ALTERED VERSION.  It was altered by John Gilmore,
 *** hoptoad!gnu, on 28 Dec 1986, to optimize characters quoted with \.
 *** THIS IS AN ALTERED VERSION.  It was altered by James A. Woods,
 *** ames!jaw, on 19 June 1987, to quash a regcomp() redundancy.
 *** THIS IS AN ALTERED VERSION.  It was altered by Matthias Bethke,

 * Main changes for Amiga shared library use:
 * - no stdio/stdlib code any more
 * - global data eliminated to make code reentrant
 * - this also meant changing almost all of the subroutine protos
 * - explicit register definitions for SAS/C added to RegComp/RegExec
 *   (also changed spelling and types to be more Amigaish :))
 *
 * *** THIS IS AN ALTERED VERSION.  It was altered for static linking in ctags.
 * *** Removed library dependencies and made standalone.
 *
 * Beware that some of this code is subtly aware of the way operator
 * precedence is structured in regular expressions.  Serious changes in
 * regular-expression syntax might require a total rethink.

/* The "internal use only" fields in regexp.h are present to pass info from
 * compile to execute that permits the execute phase to run lots faster on
 * simple cases.  They are:
 *
 * regstart	char that must begin a match; '\0' if none obvious
 * reganch	is the match anchored (at beginning-of-line only)?
 * regmust	string (pointer into program) that match must include, or NULL
 * regmlen	length of regmust string
 *
 * Regstart and reganch permit very fast decisions on suitable starting points
 * for a match, cutting down the work a lot.  Regmust permits fast rejection
 * of lines that cannot possibly match.  The regmust tests are costly enough
 * that regcomp() supplies a regmust only if the r.e. contains something
 * potentially expensive (at present, the only such thing detected is * or +
 * at the start of the r.e., which can involve a lot of backup).  Regmlen is
 * supplied because the test in regexec() needs it and regcomp() is computing
 * it anyway.

/*
 * Structure for regexp "program".  This is essentially a linear encoding
 * of a nondeterministic finite-state machine (aka syntax charts or
 * "railroad normal form" in parsing technology).  Each node is an opcode
 * plus a "next" pointer, possibly plus an operand.  "Next" pointers of
 * all nodes except BRANCH implement concatenation; a "next" pointer with
 * a BRANCH on both ends of it is connecting two alternatives.  (Here we
 * have one of the subtle syntax dependencies:  an individual BRANCH (as
 * opposed to a collection of them) is never concatenated with anything
 * because of operator precedence.)  The operand of some types of node is
 * a literal string; for others, it is a node leading into a sub-FSM.  In
 * particular, the operand of a BRANCH node is the first node of the branch.
 * (NB this is *not* a tree structure:  the tail of the branch connects
 * to the thing following the set of BRANCHes.)  The opcodes are:

/* Opcodes are defined in regexp_impl.c */

/*
 * Opcode notes:
 *
 * BRANCH	The set of branches constituting a single choice are hooked
 *		together with their "next" pointers, since precedence prevents
 *		anything being concatenated to any individual branch.  The
 *		"next" pointer of the last BRANCH in a choice points to the
 *		thing following the whole choice.  This is also where the
 *		final "next" pointer of each individual branch points; each
 *		branch starts with the operand node of a BRANCH node.
 *
 * BACK		Normal "next" pointers all implicitly point forward; BACK
 *		exists to make loop structures possible.
 *
 * STAR,PLUS	'?', and complex '*' and '+' are implemented as circular
 *		BRANCH structures using BACK.  Simple cases (one character
 *		per match) are implemented with STAR and PLUS for speed
 *		and to minimize recursive plunges.
 *
 * OPEN,CLOSE	...are numbered at compile time.
